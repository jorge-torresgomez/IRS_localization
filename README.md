# IRS_localization

This code provides a grid-search algorithm to localize mobile users within an IRS-assisted link by a base station.
We consider a communication system comprised of a BS, an IRS, and multiple MUs. We evaluate the most challenging scenario when there are NLoS conditions between the MUs and the BS. We assume fixed locations for the IRS and the BS, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The MUs will be located in the xy-plane with arbitrary coordinates and total numbers.
